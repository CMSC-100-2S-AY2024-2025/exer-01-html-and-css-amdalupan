Steps on how to create a GitHub page:
-Create a repository on GitHub
-Clone the remote repository to local
-Create an index.html file in local repository and push to remote repository
-Change remote repository visibility to public
-Configure GitHub pages via settings, selecting which branch the page will be built from
-GitHub page is now deployed 

Key takeaways:
-The simple act of organizing a page's elements/design/layout is pretty difficult via pure coding only.
-Despite this, even the most basic knowledge of html and CSS, they can be powerful tools to create meaningful, intuitive, and pleasing webpages.
-I am sure the workflow has improved over html's lifespan that it might have pretty much been perfected already. I am looking forward to learning more and exploring these tools and techniques to make development less challenging and more fulfilling/rewarding.
