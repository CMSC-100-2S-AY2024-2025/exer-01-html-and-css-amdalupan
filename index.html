                    I am Angelo Rene Dalupan, a graduating Computer Science student applying for a Frontend Software Engineer position at Gugil Co. But prior to all of this I have faced many joys and challenges of life, experienced a lot of highs and lows. My life's story began on December 22, 2001, when I was fortunately given a chance at life and experiencing what this world has to offer, to the greatest parents one could ask for. Two years after my birth, and interestingly on the same exact day, my brother was born. My life was shaping up to become an eventful one, and what an eventful one it was. I've met many great friends, discovered many interesting things for the first time too. But with this comes inevitable losses as well. But still, life goes on which has led me to today, holding my head up high and always looking forward to the future and what it may bring.
